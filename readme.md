# kotlin-springboot2

* the idea is to assemble a full working stack using kotlin/springboot2 as a rest api server talking to a postgresql db using the latest and greatest comming from the java framework land. We'll use angular7 for the frontend served by nginx, our reverse proxy of choice. 

## stack

* junit5 and mockito 
* springboot2
* kotlin
* frontend: angular7 talking to the rest api
* reverse proxy: nginx

## build

    gradle build

## run

    make
    
* then open your brower on http://localhost:8080
