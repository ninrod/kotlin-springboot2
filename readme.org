* kotlin-springboot2

The main idea is to assemble a full working stack using kotlin/springboot2 as a rest api server
talking to a postgresql db using the latest and greatest comming from the java framework land.
We'll use angular7 for the frontend served by nginx, our reverse proxy of choice.

** stack

| domain        | tech                                                            |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| reverse proxy | dockerized nginx                                                |
| frontend      | angular7                                                        |
| backend       | dockerized kotlin uberjar with springboot2 running on openjdk-8 |
| db            | dockerized postgresql                                           |
| tests         | junit5 and mockito                                              |
| logging       | logback                                                         |

** building
#+BEGIN_SRC shell

# if you don't have a running postgresql container, spin up one:
$ make db

# now just build the project
$ gradle build
#+END_SRC
** running
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ make
# then open your brower on http://localhost:8080
#+END_SRC
